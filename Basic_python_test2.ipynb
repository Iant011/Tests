    "# Theory\n",
    "1. **Basic Loop Structure:**\n",
    "   What is the fundamental structure of a `for` loop in Python, and how does it differ from a `while` loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting with `range()`:**\n",
    "   Explain how the `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers within a specified range for loop iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summing Even Numbers:**\n",
    "   Write a `for` loop that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Nested Loop Purpose:**\n",
    "   Describe a scenario where you would need to use nested loops, and provide an example code snippet illustrating this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Infinite Loop Prevention:**\n",
    "   How can you ensure that a `while` loop doesn't become an infinite loop unintentionally? Provide an example of how to implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **List Comprehension vs. `for` Loop:**\n",
    "   Compare and contrast using a list comprehension and a traditional `for` loop to generate a list of squares from 1 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Loop Control Statements:**\n",
    "   What are the purposes of `break` and `continue` statements in loops? Provide examples of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Looping Through a Dictionary:**\n",
    "   Explain how you can iterate through the keys and values of a dictionary using a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Prime Number Detection:**\n",
    "   Write a program using nested loops to determine if a given number is a prime number or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Looping with `enumerate()`:**\n",
    "    How can you use the `enumerate()` function to iterate through a list and simultaneously track the index of each element?"

    "# Questions\n",
    "1. **Basic Loop Structure:**\n",
    "   Provide an example of a `for` loop that iterates through a list of names and prints each name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting with `range()`:**\n",
    "   Write a `for` loop that prints the squares of numbers from 1 to 5 using the `range()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summing Even Numbers:**\n",
    "   Can you demonstrate how to use a `for` loop to find the sum of all odd numbers from 10 to 30 (inclusive)?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Nested Loop Purpose:**\n",
    "   Imagine you have a list of lists containing student scores for different subjects. Create a code snippet using nested loops to calculate the average score for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Infinite Loop Prevention:**\n",
    "   Share an example of a `while` loop that prints the first 5 even numbers and terminates after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **List Comprehension vs. `for` Loop:**\n",
    "   Generate a list of cubes of numbers from 1 to 7 using both a list comprehension and a traditional `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Loop Control Statements:**\n",
    "   Write a `for` loop that iterates through a list of numbers and breaks the loop when a number greater than 10 is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Looping Through a Dictionary:**\n",
    "   Provide code that iterates through a dictionary of student names and their corresponding ages, printing each name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Prime Number Detection:**\n",
    "   Create a program that takes an input number and uses nested loops to determine if it's a prime number or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Looping with `enumerate()`:**\n",
    "    Given a list of colors, use the `enumerate()` function in a loop to print each color along with its index in the list."
